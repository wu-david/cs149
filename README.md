This repository holds our final project for UC Berkeley's CS149, Fall 2014. The goal is to produce a smart locking system that locks/unlocks using an Android app via Bluetooth. It will also retaliate with a Nerf gun and uses an IMU and infrared to detected intrusion attempts. A full specification is available in the project charter, included in this repository.
