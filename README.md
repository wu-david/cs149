CS149 Final Project: Locked And Loaded
=====

This repository holds our final project for UC Berkeley's CS149, Fall 2014. The goal is to produce a smart locking system that automatically locks/unlocks on user proximity. It will also retaliate in some way to detected intrusion attempts. A full specification is available in the project charter, included in this repository.
